# Digital Audio
Sound is made up of vibrations that move through a transmission medium (gas, liquid, solid) as pressure changes. A microphone detects the pressure changes and creates an analog electrical signal that corresponds to the pressure changes.
Digital Audio is an audio signal that has been recorded as a sequence of numbers. The sound wave of the audio signal is encoded as numerical samples in a continuous sequence.
